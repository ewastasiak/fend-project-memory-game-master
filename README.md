# Udacity Memory Game Project

## Matching Game

Live version: https://ewastasiak.github.io/fend-project-memory-game-master/

## Game rules:

* While playing, you reveal pairs of cards by clicking on them. The ones that don't match - get back to the initial state (face down).
* Your goal is to match eight pairs of cards. The game ends when all the cards are successfully matched.
* When the game is finished, a modal window will appear. It will contain the time it took you to complete the game, the number of moves you made and the rating.
* You may choose to continue playing by clicking the "Replay" button.
